    "## CI Components LinkML to GraphML Converter\n",
    "Hard coded converter to move the CI Components Catalog to GraphML. Nodes and relationships are created and can be read in by Neo4j.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps and Alternatives\n",
    " - This code does no validation, it expects the users to first validate with linkml and then run this\n",
    " - This code could be generalizable, but it will be a chore. User would have to read linkml schema, get relationships, creates nodes as usual, and then with dynamic relationship information, create relationships.\n",
    "     - I would say if generalization is the goal, creating Pydantic models based off the linkml schema, validating, and creating nodes/relationships is probably the way to go. No entity or component can actually be named, it's all dynamic so that throws in some curveballs.\n",
    " - Building off of others, there is this code that can use the schema and data to output to an RDF/OWL formated TURTLE file. It requires annotations however, and I'm not quite sure how it works, I couldn't get it to work so I'm not sure if the annotations are optional or not even.\n",
    "     - Neo4j can ingest OWL/RDF files, not sure how formatting will work though.\n",
